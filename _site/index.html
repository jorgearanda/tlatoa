      <h1>Facilitation and Training</h1>

      <p>
      When people come together, great things can happen. However, group processes can be hindered by lack of facilitative and listening skills. We work in collaboration with your organization to create engaging and meaningful group processes and to build your capacity as group facilitators.

      <p>
      We also offer training programs and customized skill development workshops in these areas:

      I help organizations achieve their goals through a range of activities: program design, leadership development, conflict resolution, group facilitation, and "training for trainers" programs. I focus on arts-based adult learning, and I love creating inclusive, diverse spaces that enable creative cross-cultural communication. I integrate systems thinking into all my work, and these systemic considerations often provide the key insights to the problems I address. One of my core experiences is in the areas of higher education and student leadership development. I have designed, facilitated, and coordinated student leadership programs in Mexico, the United States, and Canada, and have supported service-learning programs and facilitated leadership development initiatives for over fifteen years.

      I am a capacity builder. I like to see my role with organizations as filling a gap.  My goal is to move an organization over a hurdle so that they can get on with their work.
      </p>
      <p>
      I have been working with non-profits and community based organizations in a range of capacities since 1997.  Much of this work has taken place overseas in the UK, Aotearoa/New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Madagascar, South Korea and the Galapagos Islands (Ecuador), as well as here in Canada. My work with organizations has spanned from teaching and training, facilitation, strategic and operational planning, monitoring and evaluation, network support and research.
      </p>
      <p>
      Building capacity has been the central theme in all of my work.  I want the organizations I work alongside to be stronger and more secure, with in-house skills they can apply to all their functions, from funding application to governance.
